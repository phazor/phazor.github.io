Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n\t// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n\t// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n\t// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n\t//\n\t// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n\t// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n\t// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n\t// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n\t//\n\t// Here's how this works:\n\t//\n\t// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n\t// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n\t// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n\t// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n\t// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n\t//\n\t// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n\t// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n\t// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n\t// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n\t// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n\t// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n\t//\n\t// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n\t// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n\t// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n\t// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n\t// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n\t// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n\t// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n\t// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n\t// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n\t// the system to stop doing the transform.

If `g` is as above and `_` is `R.__`, the\n\t * following are equivalent:\n\t *\n\t *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n\t *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n\t *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n\t *\n\t * @func\n\t * @memberOf R\n\t * @since v0.5.0\n\t * @category Function\n\t * @sig Number -> (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n\t * @param {Number} length The arity for the returned function.\n\t * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n\t * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n\t * @see R.curry\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t *      var sumArgs = (...args) => R.sum(args);\n\t *\n\t *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curryN(4, sumArgs);\n\t *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n\t *      var g = f(3);\n\t *      g(4); //=> 10\n\t */\n\tmodule.exports = _curry2(function curryN(length, fn) {\n\t  if (length === 1) {\n\t    return _curry1(fn);\n\t  }\n\t  return _arity(length, _curryN(length, [], fn));\n\t});\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 124 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\t/**\n\t * Tests whether or not an object is an array.\n\t *\n\t * @private\n\t * @param {*} val The object to test.\n\t * @return {Boolean} `true` if `val` is an array, `false` otherwise.\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t *      _isArray([]); //=> true\n\t *      _isArray(null); //=> false\n\t *      _isArray({}); //=> false\n\t */\n\tmodule.exports = Array.isArray || function _isArray(val) {\n\t  return (val != null &&\n\t          val.length >= 0 &&\n\t          Object.prototype.toString.call(val) === '[object Array]');\n\t};\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 125 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\t/**\n\t * An optimized, private array `slice` implementation.\n\t *\n\t * @private\n\t * @param {Arguments|Array} args The array or arguments object to consider.\n\t * @param {Number} [from=0] The array index to slice from, inclusive.\n\t * @param {Number} [to=args.length] The array index to slice to, exclusive.\n\t * @return {Array} A new, sliced array.\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t *      _slice([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 1, 3); //=> [2, 3]\n\t *\n\t *      var firstThreeArgs = function(a, b, c, d) {\n\t *        return _slice(arguments, 0, 3);\n\t *      };\n\t *      firstThreeArgs(1, 2, 3, 4); //=> [1, 2, 3]\n\t */\n\tmodule.exports = function _slice(args, from, to) {\n\t  switch (arguments.length) {\n\t    case 1: return _slice(args, 0, args.length);\n\t    case 2: return _slice(args, from, args.length);\n\t    default:\n\t      var list = [];\n\t      var idx = 0;\n\t      var len = Math.max(0, Math.min(args.length, to) - from);\n\t      while (idx < len) {\n\t        list[idx] = args[from + idx];\n\t        idx += 1;\n\t      }\n\t      return list;\n\t  }\n\t};\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 126 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\tvar _curry1 = __webpack_require__(23);\n\tvar _has = __webpack_require__(66);\n\tvar _isArguments = __webpack_require__(246);\n\t\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * Returns a list containing the names of all the enumerable own properties of\n\t * the supplied object.\n\t * Note that the order of the output array is not guaranteed to be consistent\n\t * across different JS platforms.\n\t *\n\t * @func\n\t * @memberOf R\n\t * @since v0.1.0\n\t * @category Object\n\t * @sig {k: v} -> [k]\n\t * @param {Object} obj The object to extract properties from\n\t * @return {Array} An array of the object's own properties.\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t *      R.keys({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}); //=> ['a', 'b', 'c']\n\t */\n\tmodule.exports = (function() {\n\t  // cover IE < 9 keys issues\n\t  var hasEnumBug = !({toString: null}).propertyIsEnumerable('toString');\n\t  var nonEnumerableProps = ['constructor', 'valueOf', 'isPrototypeOf', 'toString',\n\t                            'propertyIsEnumerable', 'hasOwnProperty', 'toLocaleString'];\n\t  // Safari bug\n\t  var hasArgsEnumBug = (function() {\n\t    'use strict';\n\t    return arguments.propertyIsEnumerable('length');\n\t  }());\n\t\n\t  var contains = function contains(list, item) {\n\t    var idx = 0;\n\t    while (idx < list.length) {\n\t      if (list[idx] === item) {\n\t        return true;\n\t      }\n\t      idx += 1;\n\t    }\n\t    return false;\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  return typeof Object.keys === 'function' && !hasArgsEnumBug ?\n\t    _curry1(function keys(obj) {\n\t      return Object(obj) !== obj ?

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\n\nfunction TransformState(options, stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function(er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb)\n    return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (!util.isNullOrUndefined(data))\n    stream.push(data);\n\n  if (cb)\n    cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform))\n    return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(options, this);\n\n  // when the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  this.once('prefinish', function() {\n    if (util.isFunction(this._flush))\n      this._flush(function(er) {\n        done(stream, er);\n      });\n    else\n      done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function(chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.
